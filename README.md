# Pokémon Look Up
A dynamic web application that allows users to search and explore Pokémon information using the PokeAPI. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this tool provides an interactive way to discover Pokémon details including stats, sprites, and type information.

## Features

- **Search by Name or ID**: Look up any Pokémon using their name or Pokédex number
- **Interactive Navigation**: Navigate between Pokémon using forward/backward buttons
- **Random Pokémon Generator**: Discover random Pokémon with the randomize feature
- **Visual Stats Display**: View base stats in an interactive radar chart
- **Dual Sprite View**: Compare regular and shiny sprites side by side
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern interface with hover effects and smooth animations

## Project Status
This project is currently in development. I am restructuring PokémonLookUp as a NextJS project and giving it a complete UI overhaul.
